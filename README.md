# Nitrogen

Nitrogen is a Nuxt template inspired by Shopify's Hydrogen framework for headless commerce. This template is designed to empower Nuxt and Vue developers to build fast, scalable, and customizable storefronts, incorporating key features from Hydrogen‚Äôs starter theme.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This template is designed for developers who are already familiar with the GraphQL Storefront API and have prior experience building headless storefronts.

## ‚ú® Key Features

## üöÄ Get Started

> [!NOTE]
> Nitrogen provides a solid foundation for headless Shopify development in Nuxt, but comes with opinionated choices regarding project structure and organization. Feel free to customize the queries, functions, pages, and components to match your project's specific needs!

## üõçÔ∏è Shopify Setup

Before using Nitrogen, you must configure your Shopify store as follows:

### API Permissions

Within your Shopify admin dashboard, create a custom app and configure the necessary Storefront API permissions needed for your project. Enable all Storefront API access scopes to keep things simple. Once the app is created, retrieve your storefront API access token to use in the project‚Äôs environment variables.

### Localization

To support international currencies and localized experiences, enable Markets within your Shopify admin dashboard. Navigate to `Settings` > `Markets` > `Preferences` and configure your global currency markets. This ensures that customers can see prices in their local currency and switch markets if needed.

### Filtering Products

To enable product filtering, install the [Shopify Search & Discovery](https://apps.shopify.com/search-and-discovery?search_id=81e9e3f8-f482-4c8c-83c2-a80090d606df&surface_detail=search+and+discovery&surface_inter_position=1&surface_intra_position=5&surface_type=search) app and set up basic filters. This template uses the `availability`, `color`, `size`, and `productType` filter options. You'll likely need to remove some default filter options within the filter admin settings, or you can add more filters if needed.

To modify the available filter options, you'll need to update two files:

1. Update the [`getFilterValuesFromUrl`](https://github.com/rylanharper/Nitrogen/blob/4119b6b3edfea0afb87eebba50bcfe77882cfc9a/app/composables/use-collection-helpers.ts#L83) composable function to define your filter options
2. Modify the [`filter-menu.vue`](https://github.com/rylanharper/Nitrogen/blob/master/app/components/filter/filter-menu.vue) component to include your filter mapping functions

For example, here's how a filter map function works for color options:

```ts
const colorOptions = computed(() => {
  const colorOptionNames = ['Color', 'Colour'];
  const allColors = new Set(
    props.products
      .flatMap((product) => product.options)
      .filter((option) => colorOptionNames.includes(option.name))
      .flatMap((option) => option.optionValues)
      .map((value) => value.name)
  );

  return Array.from(allColors).sort();
});
```

### Metafields

Nitrogen uses a custom `related_products` metafield (list type) to display related products on your product pages. This metafield allows you to reference the full data of related products, which is ideal for managing matching color swatches, media, and more. This metafield can be seen in the main [`product.ts`](https://github.com/rylanharper/Nitrogen/blob/4119b6b3edfea0afb87eebba50bcfe77882cfc9a/server/graphql/queries/product.ts) GraphQL query:

```ts
related_products: metafield(namespace: "custom", key: "related_products") {
  references(first: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        ...Product
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can create additional product reference metafields by copying this query structure and changing the key name. This enables you to build features like:

- Color swatch coordination with `matching_colors`
- "Styled with" collections using `styled_with`
- Custom merchandising groups via `frequently_bought_together`

## üß© Nuxt Setup

To begin using Nitrogen, you'll need to set up the following environment variables:

```ini
NUXT_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT=
NUXT_SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=
NUXT_SHOPIFY_API_VERSION=
```

> [!WARNING]
> It is strongly recommended that you use the `2024-07` API version or higher. If not, you will not have access to new API features found within this template (this will cause breaking changes).

### Development

1. Install dependencies using `pnpm install`
2. Generate your project types using `pnpm codgen`
3. Start the development server using `pnpm run dev`

## üèì Basic Usage

Nitrogen provides a type-safe GraphQL client that seamlessly integrates with Shopify's Storefront API. It uses a server-side proxy to handle API authentication and requests, while offering a strongly-typed interface for executing GraphQL operations.

### GraphQL Operations

This project includes pre-built GraphQL operations for common Shopify queries and mutations, such as retrieving cart data, localization, and more. All available operations can be found in the [operations folder](https://github.com/rylanharper/Nitrogen/tree/master/server/operations). Feel free to add or remove operations that fit your project needs.

### Composable

To get GraphQL operations, use the `useShopify` composable:

```ts
const shopify = useShopify();
```

Operations can be referenced using this composable with dot notation:

```ts
// Shopify
const shopify = useShopify();

// With dot notation
await shopify.cart.addLines(cart.id, [ ... ])
await shopify.product.get({ handle: 'example-product' })
```

### With `useAsyncData`

Perfect for reactive data fetching in pages or components:

```ts
// Shopify
const shopify = useShopify();

// Fetch data
const productVars = computed<ProductQueryVariables>(() => ({
  handle: handle.value,
  country: shopStore.buyerCountryCode,
  language: shopStore.buyerLanguageCode
}))

const { data: productData } = await useAsyncData(
  `product-${handle.value}`,
  () => shopify.product.get(productVars.value),
  { watch: [productVars] }
);

// Computed data
const product = computed(() => productData.value)
```

### With `Pinia`

Ideal for working with actions in your Pinia stores:

```ts
// Shopify
const shopify = useShopify();

// Cart actions
actions: {
  async createCart(input?: CartInput, optionalParams?: CartOptionalInput) {
    try {
      const response = await shopify.cart.create({
        input: input,
        ...optionalParams
      });
      
      if (response?.cart) {
        this.cart = response.cart;
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('No cart returned from cartCreate mutation', error);
    }
  },
  // More actions...
}
```
